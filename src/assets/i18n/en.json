        "LINEAR_EXPLANATION": "The generated equation is a linear relationship between {{ labelX }} and {{ labelY }}. The slope indicates the rate of change of {{ labelY }} per unit of {{ labelX }}, while the intercept represents the value of {{ labelY }} when {{ labelX }} equals zero.",
        "LINEAR_SLOPE_TITLE": "How is a slope interpreted?",
        "LINEAR_SLOPE_DESCRIPTION": "The slope of a line represents how much {{ labelY }} changes for each unit of {{ labelX }}.",
        "LINEAR_SLOPE_POSITIVE": "- If the slope is positive, it means {{ labelY }} increases as {{ labelX }} increases.",
        "LINEAR_SLOPE_NEGATIVE": "- If the slope is negative, it means {{ labelY }} decreases as {{ labelX }} increases.",
        "LINEAR_SLOPE_ZERO": "- A slope of zero indicates no change in {{ labelY }}, regardless of {{ labelX }}.",
        "POLYNOMIAL_EXPLANATION": "The generated equation is a polynomial relationship between {{ labelX }} and {{ labelY }}. The coefficients determine the shape of the curve, including its curvature and inflection points.",

        "EXPONENTIAL_EXPLANATION": "The generated equation is an exponential relationship between {{ labelX }} and {{ labelY }}. This means that {{ labelY }} grows or decreases proportionally to a power of {{ labelX }}.",
